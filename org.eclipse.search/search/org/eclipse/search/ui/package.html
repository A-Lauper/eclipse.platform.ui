Provides classes and interfaces for search pages.
New search dialog pages can be contributed via a plug-in extension point.
This package provides the interfaces and classes to implement these dialog
pages and offers hooks to populate the search result view.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>

<p>To contribute to the search dialog using the 'searchPages' extension point a
dialog page must implement <tt>ISearchPage</tt>. A search page
has access to its <tt>ISearchPageContainer</tt> to modify search
dialog properties.

<p>The search view that shows result has been rewritten for 3.0. It is recommended
to use the following new API:
<p>
<p>Search queries are represented by instances of type <tt>ISearchQuery</tt>. They
are run by API on <tt>NewSearchUI</tt> and create a <code>ISearchResult</code> as result.
<p>Clients have to contribute a search result page (<tt>ISearchResultPage</tt>) that can
visualize the matches contained in the result set.
<p>
<p>For compatibility to search views written prior to 3.0 the following APIs still exist:
<p>
<p>Old searches create markers for search matches. The search view uses <tt>IGroupByKeyComputer</tt> to group
these markers and present these groups as elements of type <tt>ISearchResultViewEntry</tt>.
